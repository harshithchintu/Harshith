# count vowels
# take a word as param and return number of vowels

# To achieve this, you can use a for loop to iterate through each character in the word.
# Then, you can check if the character is a vowel using a conditional statement.
# If the character is a vowel, you increment a counter variable. Finally, you return the counter variable as the result.

def vowels(word):
    vowel = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    counter = 0
    for n in word:
        if n in vowel:
            counter += 1
    print(f'Number of vowels in your word is: {counter}')
    print('Your word is: ',word)
        
word = input('enter a word: ')
